            The new proposal attempts to reconnect the Porta conceptually back to its past as the gateway
            that
            marks one's entry into and out of the city. Thus, circulation from inside the city to outside the city
            is re-thought as a continuous line that starts inside the city, exits through the gate, comes up the slope
            through
            a zigzag fashion, then cutsthrough Piazza Michelangelo, and then finally continues along the hillside and
            comes
            to astop at the staircase that brings one up to San Miniato.The proposal is to be understood
            architecturallyas a
            versatile and continuous public arcade that also serves as a structure in which multiple affordable unit
            housing
            and possible commercial spaces can attach themselves to Poggi’s existing route remains mostly
            intact underneath
            the arcade mainly for vehiular circulation while the arcade will function solely as anuninterrupted
            pedestrian
            route
            to San Miniato.

            The Syracuse University School of Architecture has grown in enrollment, and the school’s
            library system is
            always reassessing how they can best serve their
            students and faculty. In order to tackle the growing information collected by the Reading Room, an annex is
            added to Slocum Hall’s southern side. The site speaks to the principal pedestrian pathways of the campus
            through
            the bus stop and the main quad of the university. The skin’s pattern comes from the veins of a leaf to make
            the
            building feel as if it is an extension to Sugar Maples found hroughout Syracuse.Integrated with
            Comprehensive
            Studio, the project is about a versatile skin enclosure that functions to activate existing urban spaces.The
            skin in a contemporary architectural intervention to the modern column grid rationale. The skin functions as
            a
            shading device, but also as a maker of public space.

            The proposal for the competition is a transformative mesh that changes as one moves through
            the courtyard. It is an inspiration of comtemporary dancer, Martha Graham.
